    "The Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas, Machine Learning in Python by Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili as well as The Riemann Problem for Hyperbolic PDEs: Theory and Approximate Solvers in Python by David I. Ketcheson, Randall J. LeVeque, and Mauricio del Razo Sarminaserved served as inspiration and examples of using Jupyter notebooks to construct a book. The bookbook repository on github provided a starting point for the tooling to convert the book from jupyter notebooks to the web and into print."
