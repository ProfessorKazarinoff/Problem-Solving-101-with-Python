Other programs running on your computer include Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and a web browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Each of these prgrams use a different file type. The file type the Python Interpreter run are files that contain Python code. You can think of the Python Interpreter like a cook in a resteraunt that only does exactly as the cook reads in the recipie. The recipie is kind of like Python code. It contains instructions for the cook to run. "

    "Guido created Python based on his experience working with another earlier computer programming language called ABC. Guido had a couple of \"gripes\" with the ABC programming language including it's lack of extensability<cite data-cite=\"https://docs.python.org/3.6/faq/general.html#why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place\"><sup><1></sup></cite>. He wrote Python partly in response to this problem. Unlike ABC, Python is indeed very extensible. It can be extended with additional packages downloaded from the PyPI.org and runs on servers, desktop computers, laptops and tiny microcontrollers."
