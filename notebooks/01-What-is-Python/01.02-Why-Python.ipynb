    "Python has an extensive standard library. A huge number of object types, functions and methods are available for use without importing any external modules or packages. These include math functions, list methods, and calls to a computer's system. There is a lot that can be done with the Python Standard Library. The first couple chapters of this book will just use the Python Standard Library. It can do a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python defines the types of objects you build into your code. Unlike some other languages such as C, you do not need to declare the object type. The object type is also mutable, you can change the type of object easily and on the fly. There is a wide array of object types built into Python. Objects can change in size. Python objects can also contain mixed data types. For example, strings and floating point numbers can be items in the same list.\n",

    "Python has over 100,000 external packages available for download and use. They are easy to install off of the Python Package Index, commonly called PyPI (\"pie pee eye\"). There is a Python package for just about everything. There are packages which can help you: interact with the web, make complex computations, do unit conversions, plot data, work with .csv, .xls, and .pdf files, manipulate images and video, read data from sensors and test equipment, train machine learning algorithms, design web apps, work with GIS data, work with astronautical data, and many more added every day. In this book we will use some of the more useful Python packages for problem solving such as **numpy** and **matplotlib**."

    "Engineers solve the world's problems in teams. One way Python helps solve these problems faster than other programming languages is that it is easy to learn and use. A Python program tends to be shorter and quicker to write than a program that does a similar function written in other computer programming language. In the rapid design, prototype, test, iterate cycle programming solutions made with Python can be spun up quickly. Python is also an easy language for fellow engineers on your team to learn. It is also quite human readable. While programmers can become preoccupied with a program's running speed, it is program development time that takes the longest.\n",
