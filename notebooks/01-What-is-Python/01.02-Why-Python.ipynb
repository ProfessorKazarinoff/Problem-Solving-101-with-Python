    "\n",
    "Problem solvers work to solve the world's problems in temas. One way Python helps solve these problems faster than other programming languages is that it is easy to learn and use. A Python program tends to be shorter and quicker to write than a program that solves the same problem written in other computer programming language. In the rapid design, prototype, test, iterate cycle programming solutions made with Python can be spun up quickly. Python is also an easy language for fellow engineers on your team to learn. Python code is also quite human readable. While programmers can become preoccupied with a program's execution speed, development time takes the longest. Shorter development times mean problems are often solved faster using Python.\n",
