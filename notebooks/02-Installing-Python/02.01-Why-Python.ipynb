    "\n",
    "One way Python helps solve problems faster than other programming languages is that it is easy to learn and use. Python programs tends to be shorter and quicker to write than a program that does a similar function written in another computer programming language. In the rapid design-prototype-test-iterate cycle, programming solutions built with Python can be spun up quickly. Python is also an easy language for fellow engineers on your team to learn. It is also quite human readable. While programmers can become preoccupied with a programs run time, it is development time that takes the longest.\n",

Just open up a terminal in on a Mac OSX or Linux machine and type \\texttt{python}. That's it, you are now using Python. On Windows I recommend downloading and using the Ananaconda distribution. The Anaconda distrobution is free and can be installed on all three major operating systems. The same programming environment can be replecated accross the three different opperating systems.\n",

Many more packages, scripts and utilities can be found in open source repos on github and bitbucket. \n",
