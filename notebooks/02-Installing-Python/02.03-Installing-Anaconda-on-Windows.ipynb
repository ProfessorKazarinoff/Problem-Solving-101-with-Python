    "In this section, we will run through installing the Anaconda distribution of Python on Windows 10. I think the Anaconda distribution of Python is the the best option for undergraduate engineers who want to use Python. Anaconda is free (although the download is large which can take time) and can be installed on school or work computers where you don't have administrator access or the ability to install new programs. Anaconda comes bundled with over 100 packages pre-installed including **numpy**, **matplotlib** and **pandas**. These three packages are very useful for engineers and will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n",
