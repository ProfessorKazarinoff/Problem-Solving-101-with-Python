    "A couple points to review in the short example above. First a variable, called ```a```, is assigned the value ```5```. Next a new variable ```f_string``` is assigned the value ```f'the number is {a}'```. The string ```f'the number is {a}'``` is an f-string. Notice how the letter ```f``` comes before the quotation mark that denotes the string. Inside the f-string, there is a variable enclosed in curly braces ```{a}```. Using curly braces within a f-string inserts the value of a pre-defined variable into the string. Since ```a``` was assigned a value of ```5```, when ```f'the number is {a}'``` is printed, the output seen is ```the number is 5```. Note how ```{a}``` was replaced with ```5``` and the output does not contain curly braces ```{ }```."
