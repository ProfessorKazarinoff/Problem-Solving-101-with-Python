    "There are a number of things going on in the short example above. First a variable, called ```a``` is assigned the value ```5```. Next a new variable ```f_string``` is assigned the value ```f'the number is {a}'```. This is an f-string. Notice how the letter ```f``` comes before the quotation mark to denote the string. Inside the f-string there is a variable enclosed in curly braces ```{a}```. Using curly braces in an f-string inserts the value of a pre-defined variable into the string. Since ```a``` was assigned a value of ```5```, when ```f'the number is {a}'``` is printed, the output seen is ```the number is 5```. Note how ```{a}``` was replaced with ```5```."
