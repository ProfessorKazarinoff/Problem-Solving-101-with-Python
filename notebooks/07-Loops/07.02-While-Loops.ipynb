The second line declared a while loop using the keyword ```while``` and the logical condition ```i<4```. The logical condition ```i<4``` will be ```True``` or ```False``` depending on the variable ```i```. Since ```i=0```, the logical condition ```i<4``` is ```True``` and the for loop starts to run. The code that run inside the loop prints the value of ```i``` then increases ```i``` by ```1```. Eventually, when ```i=4```, the statement ```i<4``` is ```False``` and the while loop ends."

If the while statement can't be evaluated as ```True``` or ```False```, Python will throw an error. It is therefore necessary to convert the user's input from a string to a float.
