    "Now let's turn the Feather Huzzah's built-in LED on and off. The Feather Huzzah has a built-in red LED connected to Pin 0. We can access this LED with Micropython's ```machine``` module. First we use the ```machine``` module to create a ```Pin``` object. The first argument when we instantiate the ```Pin``` object is the pin number on the board (in this case ```0```). Pin zero on the Feather Huzzah is connected to the built-in red LED. The second argument is the pin type. We want Pin 0 to act as an ouput pin (```machine.Pin.OUT```). We are going to assign our ```pin``` the attribute ```.on()``` or ```.off()```. This will cause the Feather board to output a positive voltage or no voltage to Pin 0 to turn the built-in red LED on and off. You can also connect Pin 0 to an LED through a resistor (then to ground) and have this LED turn on and off.\n",

To run the loop, we type backspace on an empty line (to backspace from an indented line) and hit return.\n",
