    "Now we need to write the Python code that we are going to put on the board. The board has two main Python files: **boot.py** and **main.py**. We can also add additional files to the board. **boot.py** is the file that runs first when the board is powered up. After **boot.py** runs, then **main.py** will run. We can add other **.py** files to the board to provide **main.py** some functions and classes to work with. We have two general things to do with our Feather board, reading temperature and posting it to the ThingSpeak. So let's use two different **.py** files for each of these general functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first **MCP9808.py** file will simplify reading temperature data off of the Adafruit MCP9808 temperature breakout. We will write a function that parses out the temperature data from the I2C bus and return it as the output for our **readtemp** function. The function needs to import the ```machine``` module to use the I2C bus. The machine module will allow us to create a new i2c object. When we create the object, we need to specify the ```scl``` and ```sda``` pins that the sensor is connected to. ```scl``` is the i2c clock line and ```sda``` is the i2c data line. These are pins 5 and 4 on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah. Then a new byte array variable needs to be created, so that we can later write data from the sensor into it.  Next we need to read the sensor data using the ```i2c.readfrom_mem_into()``` function. The first argument is the I2C bus address for the sensor. In this case the sensor is at I2C bus address ```24```. You can use the line ```>>> i2c.scan()``` in the micropython REPL to see this value.  The next function argument is the register on the MCP9808 temperature sensor where the temperature value is stored, which happens to be register ```5```. If we access register ```5``` on the MCP, we will read in the temperature. The third arguments is the variable that we store the temperature data into. The ```i2c.readfrom_mem_into``` function changes the variable that is a function argument, rather than changing a variable which is the function output as most functions do. This is why we need to first create the ```byte_data``` variable before calling the function. Next we need to do some post processing of the byte array to transform it into a temperature in degrees C.\n",
