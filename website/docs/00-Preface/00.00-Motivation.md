# Preface
## Motivation
The motivation for writing this book is that many undergraduate engineering students have to take a prgramming course based on MATLAB. MATLAB is a great piece of software, but it currently costs $49.00 for a student licence and requires a site licence to be used on school computers. Subsequently, it is costly for a student to use MATLAB and it is costly for a college to support a course that uses MATLAB. 

The Python programming language on the other hand is open source and free. To download and use Python, the cost to both the student and the college is zero. By moving an undergradate engineering programming class to Python, students will save money and have greater access to the software they use in class. Further in their engineering education, students can continue to use Python for free.
