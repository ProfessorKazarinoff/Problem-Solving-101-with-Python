You will most likely see version 2.7 is installed. To install The Anaconda distridution of Python follow the steps below:

#### Steps:

1. Visit [Anaconda.com/downloads](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

2. Select Mac OSX

3. Download the .pkg installer

4. Move the .pkg file to the Apps folder

5. Open the Anaconda prompt and run some Python code
#### 1. Visit the Anaconda downloads page
