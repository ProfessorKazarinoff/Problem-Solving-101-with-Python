## Installing Python from Python.org
Below are the recommended ways to install a new version of Python from Python.org on the three major operating systems: Windows, MacOS and Linux. This book is based on Python version 3.6.  Some of the problems may not work properly on legacy Python (version 2.7).  The author's recommend using the Anaconda distribution of Python on Windows and MacOS. The installation of Anaconda was detailed in the previous sections of this chapter.

### Installing Python on Linux

Go to open a terminal and enter ```$ python``` to see if a version of Python is already installed on the system. If the Python version is 2.7 or below, download the newest release in the apt repositories.

```
$ sudo apt-get python3.6
```

After installation you will need to append your PATH variable to ensure the newly installed Python3.6 version is the version of Python called when using the terminal
