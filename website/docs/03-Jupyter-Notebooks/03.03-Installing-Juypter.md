## Installing Juypter
To install **Jupyter Notebooks**, the simplest way is to use the **Anaconda** distribution of Python. The **Anaconda** distribution of Python has **Jupyter Notebooks** pre-installed and no further steps are necessary.
### Installing Jupyter on Windows

To install jupyter on Windows, open the **Anaconda Prompt** and type:

```
> conda install jupyter
```

Type ```y``` for yes when prompted.

Alternativly, open a **command prompt** and type:

```
> pip install jupyter
```
### Installing Jupyter on Mac OSX

To install jupyter on Mac OSX, open the OSX terminal and type:

```
$ conda install jupyter
```

Type ```y``` for yes when prompted.

If **conda** is not installed, the Anaconda Distribution of Python can be installed, which should install **conda** for use in the MacOS terminal.

Alternativly Jupyter Notebooks can be installed on using the MacOS termal and typing:

```
$ pip install jupyter
```

or

```
$ pip3 install jupyter
```


Note there are problems using the system version of Python on MacOS. Packages may not install on the system version of Python. And packages which do install on the system version of Python may not run correctly. It is therefore recommended that MacOS users install the Anaconda distribution of Python or use **homebrew** to install a seperate non-system version of Python from the command line with:

```
$ brew install Python
```
