## Python as a fancy calculator
Python can be used as a fancy calculator to do arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It can also be used for trigonometric calculations and statistical calculations.
### Arithmetic

Python can be used as a calculator to make simple or complex calculations. 

We can do this easily with Python at the Python Prompt, often called the Python REPL for Read Evaluate Print Loop. The Python REPL shows three arrow symbols ```>>>``` after which you will see a blinking cursor. Programmers type commands at the prompt then hit [ENTER]. The is Read by the interperator, results of running the commands are Evaluated then Printed to the command window.  After the output a new ```>>>``` prompt appears on a new line. This process happens over and over again (in a loop). Try the following commands at the Python REPL:

1. The mass of a battery is 5 kg and the mass of the battery cables is 3 kg. What is the mass of the battery cable assembly?

```
>>> 5 + 3
8
```

2. Suppose one of the cables above is removed and it has a mass of 1.5 kg. What is the mass of the left over assembly

```
>>> 8 - 1.5
6.5
```



3. If the battery has a mass of 5000 g and a volume of 2500 $cm^3$ What is the density of the battery? The formula for density is below, where D is density, m is mass and v is volume.

$$ D = \frac{m}{v} $$

In the problem above $m = 5000$ and $v=2500$

Let's solve this with Python

```
>>> 5000 / 2500
2.0
```

4. What if we have 2 batteries that each weight 5 kg? How much mass is two batteries?

```
>>> 5 * 2
2.0
```

5. The dimension of the battery of each battery is 3 cm. What is the area of the base of the battery?
To do this probems we use the the ** symbol to raise a number to a power. This is similar to using $3^2$.

```
>>> 3 ** 2
9
```

6. What is the volume of the battery if each the length, width and height of the battery are all 3cm?

```
>>> 3 ** 3
27
```

7. Find the mass of the two batteries, and two cables

We can use Python to find the mass of the batteries and then use the answer, which Python saves as an underscore \_ to use in our next operation. (This is similar to ans in MatLab)

```
>>> 2 * 5 
10
>>> _ + 1.5 + 1
12.5
```
#### Section Summary

A summary of the arithmetic operations in python are below

### Trig: sin, cos, tan
Python as a fancy calculator is not limited to simple arithmetic. Trig functions sin, cos and tan are also available. In order to use these functions, we need to learn a new concept: importing modules. 
In python there are many functions built into the language when it starts. These include + , -, *, / like we say in the last section. However not all functions will work right when python starts. Say we want to find the sin of an angle. Try the following:

```
>>> sin(60)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'sin' is not defined
```

This error is returned because we have not told python to include the sin function. The sin function is part of the \textit{standard library}. The standard library comes with every python installation and includes many functions, but not all of these functions are available to us when we start a new python window. In order to use the sin function, we first need to import it from math \textit{module} which is part of the standard library. 

Importing modules and functions is easy. We use the following syntax: from \textit{module name} import textit{function name} 

To import the sin function from the math module try:

```
>>> from math import sin
>>> sin(60)
-0.3048106211022167
```

success! You can also import multiple modules at once. Say we want to use a bunch of different trig functions to solve the following problem.

1. A vector is at an angle of pi/6 radians. What is the sin, cos and tan of the angle?

To solve this problem we need to import the sin, cos, and tan fuctions. It would also be usefull to have the value of pi, rather than having to write 3.14.... We can import these all at the same time with commas in between. 

Try:

```
>>> from math import sin, cos, tan, pi
>>> pi
3.141592653589793
>>> pi/4
0.7853981633974483
>>> sin(pi/4)
0.7853981633974483
>>> sin(2*pi)
```

cos
tan
pi
degrees(x) rad --> deg
radians(x) deg --> rad
asin
acos
atan
### Exponents and Logarithms

It is easy to calculate expnents and logarithms as well. Note that these need to be imported from the **math** module just like the trig functions above. 

The following functions can be imported from the math module:

log
log10
exp
e
pow(x,y)
sqrt

Let's try a couple of examples

```
>>> from math import log, log10, exp, e, pow, sqrt
>>> F = 3.0*e**3.4  
>>> log(F)         # note: natural log
4.4986122886681095
```

triangle with sides 3 and 4 what is the hypotenuse?

```
>>> a=3
>>> b=4
>>> c=sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
>>> c
5.0 
```

The power function works like the ```**``` operator to raise a number to a power

```
>>> a = 5**2
>>> a
```

```
>>> b = pow(5,2)
>>> b
25.0
```

Problem: The arranous relationship states that

$$ n = n_{v}e^{-Q_v/(RT)} $$


```
>>> nv = 2.0**(-0.3)
>>> Qv = 5
>>> R = 3.18
>>> T = 293
>>> n = nv*e**(-1*Qv/(R*T))
>>> n
0.8079052775625613
```
### Staticstics

To round out this section, we will look at a couple of statistics functions. These functions are part of the **standard library** but not part of the **math** module. To access these statistics functions we need to import them from the **statistics** module using the statement ```from statistics import mean, median, mode, stdev```. Then the functions ```mean```, ```median```, ```mode``` and ```stdev```(standard deviation) can be used.  

```
>>> from statistics import mean, median, mode, stdev
    
>>> test_scores = [ 60 , 83, 83, 91, 100]
    
>>> mean(test_scores)
83.4

>>> median(test_scores)
83

>>> mode(test_scores)
83
    
>>> stdev(test_scores) # standard deviation of a sample
14.842506526863986 
```

Alternativly, we can import the whole **statistics** module using the statement ```import statistics```. Then to use the functions, we need to use the names ```statistics.mean```, ```statistics.median```, ```statistics.mode```, and ```statistics.stdev```. See below:

```
>>> import statistics
    
>>> test_scores = [ 60 , 83, 83, 91, 100]
    
>>> statistics.mean(test_scores)
83.4

>>> statistics.median(test_scores)
83

>>> statistics.mode(test_scores)
83
    
>>> statistics.stdev(test_scores) # standard deviation of a sample
14.842506526863986 
```
