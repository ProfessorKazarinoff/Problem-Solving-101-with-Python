## Variables and Data Types
Variables are assigned in Python using the ```=``` equals sign also called the assignment opperator. The statment:

```
a = 2
```

Assigns the integer ```2``` to the variable ```a```. Note this is different from the logical opperator ```==``` equivalent to.
```python
>>> a = 2
>>> a
2
```
```python
>>> a == 2
True
```
Problem: The Arrhenius relationship states that

$$ n = n_{v}e^{-Q_v/(RT)} $$

We can use variables to assign a value to each one of the constants in the problem.

```python
>>> nv = 2.0**(-0.3)
>>> Qv = 5
>>> R = 3.18
>>> T = 293
>>> n = nv*e**(-1*Qv/(R*T))
>>> n
0.8079052775625613
```
