## Boolean Arithmetic
The _boolean_ data type is either True or False. In Python, boolean variables are defined by the keywords ```True``` and ```False```. 

```python
>>> a = True
>>> type(a)
<class 'bool'>

>>> b = False
>>> type(b)
<class 'bool'>
```

Note that ```True``` and ```False``` must have an Upper Case first letter. Using a lowercase ```true``` returns an error.

```python
>> c = true
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'true' is not defined
d = false
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'false' is not defined
```
### Integers and Floats as Booleans

An int, float or complex number set to zero will always return ```False```. An int, float or complex number set to any other number, positive or negative, will return ```True```.

```python
>>> zero_int = 0
>>> bool(zero_int)
False
```

```python
>>> pos_int = 1
>>> bool(pos_int)
True
```

```python
>>> neg_flt = -5.1
>>> bool(neg_flt)
True
```
Boolean arithmetic is the arithmetic of logic, the arithmetic of ```True``` and ```False```. A boolean variable or logical value can either be ```True``` or ```False```. The keywords ```not```, ```or```, ```and``` are used to modify and combine boolean values. The double equals sign ```==``` is used to test for equality. Note this is different than variable assignment which is accomplished with a single equals sign ```=```. The symbol ```!=``` tests for inequality. If two boolean values are not than, ```!=``` between them will produce ```True```. 

Examples of boolean arithmetic are below: 
```python
>>> A = True
>>> B = False
```
```python
>>> not A
False
```
```python
>>> not B
True
```
```python
>>> A == B
False
````
```python
>>> A != B
True
```
```python
>>> A or B
True
```
```python
>>> A and B
False
```
A summary of boolean arithmetic and operators is shown in the table below.

| A | B | not A | not B | A == B | A != B | A or B | A and B |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T   |   F |   F |   T |   F |   T |   T |   F |
| F   |   T |   T |   F |   F |   T |   T |   F |
| T   |   T |   F |   F |   T |   F |   T |   T |
| F   |   F |   T |   T |   T |   F |   F |   F |
