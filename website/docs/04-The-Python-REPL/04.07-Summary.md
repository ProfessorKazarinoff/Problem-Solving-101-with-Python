## Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to use the Python REPL, also called the Python prompt, to solve calculation problems. 

In the first section of the chapter, you learned what the Python is. REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop. The Python REPL is also sometimes called the Python Prompt.

You learned how to do arithmetic with Python. Addition and subtraction are completed with ```+``` and ```-```. Division and multiplication are completed with ```/``` and ```*```.  To raise a number to a power (exponents) in Python, use ```***```. 

You learned how to import Python's ```math``` module and use functions from the ```math``` module to complete problems with powers and logarithms, and trigonometry. Python ```statistics``` module includes statistical functions such as ```mean()```, ```median()```, ```mode()``` and ```std()``` (standard deviation). 

In the middle of the chapter, you learned about four data types in Python. Two numeric data types were integers and floats (decimals). Boolean values can only be ```True``` or ```False```. Strings are sequences of letters, numbers, symbols and spaces. In Python, strings can be defined with either single ```' '``` or double ```" "``` quotes.

At the end of the chapter, you learned about Python's ```print()``` function. The chapter concluded with a couple string operations including concatenation (combining), repetition (using ```*```) and indexing. When a string is indexed, the general form is```string[index]``` or ```string[start:stop:step]```. Remember, in Python, counting starts at ```0``` and ends at ```n-1```. To call the first index in a string, use ```string[0]```. The second character in the string is accessed with the command ```string[1]```.
