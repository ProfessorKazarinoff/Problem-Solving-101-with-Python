## What is Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is a popular Python package used to plot data. Matplotlib started as a project in the early 2000's partly to to use Python to visualize the electonic signals in the brain of epilepsy patients. Matplotlib's creator, John D. Hunter was a neurobilogist. He was looking for way to replicate MATLAB's plotting capability with Python. In addition to starting matplotlib, Dr. Hunter was part of the founding group that created Numfocus. The Numfocus group oversees some major Python projects including matplotlib, numpy, pandas and jupyter.
### Why use Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is useful for creating static 2D plot, the kind included in scientific publications and presentations. Almost any plot created in Micrsoft Excel can be created with matplotlib.
