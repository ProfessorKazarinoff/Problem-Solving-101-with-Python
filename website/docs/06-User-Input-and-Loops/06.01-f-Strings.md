## f-Strings
Python can print data back to a user in a number of ways. One of these ways is using _f-strings_.  An f-string is a string pre-pended with an ```f``` that can include variables in curley braces.
<div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered">

<div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text">

</pre>
</div>

There are a number of things going on in the short example above. First a variable, called ```a``` is assigned the value ```5```. Next a new variable ```f_string``` is assigned the value ```f'the number is {a}'```. This is an f-string. Notice how the letter ```f``` comes before the quotation mark to denote the string. Inside the f-string there is a variable in curely braces ```{a}```. Using curley braces in an f-string inserts the value of a pre-defined variable into the string. Since ```a``` was assigned a value of ```5```, when ```f'the number is {a}'``` is printed, the output seen is ```the number is 5```. Note how ```{a}``` was replaced with ```5```.
We can compare the difference between a regular string and an f-string by printing out two different statements:
<div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered">
<div class="input">
<div class="prompt input_prompt">In&nbsp;[1]:</div>
<div class="inner_cell">
    <div class="input_area">
<div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"><pre><span></span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="s1">&#39;The f-string says a is equal to </span><span class="si">{a}</span><span class="s1">&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;The regular string says a is equal to </span><span class="si">{a}</span><span class="s1">&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="output">


<div class="output_area">

<div class="prompt"></div>


<div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text">
<pre>The f-string says a is equal to 5
The regular string says a is equal to {a}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
Note how the first line printed shows ```a is equal to 5``` and the second line shows ```a is equal to {a}```. The first print line was an f-string, so the value of ```a```, which is ```5``` was shown. The second print line was a regular string, so the value of ```a``` is not inserted, and instead we see ```{a}```.
