## While Loops
A _While Loop_ is a type of loop that will continue running as long as a condition is ```True```. When the condition becomes ```False``` the loop will stop running. The general form of a while loop is below:

```
while <true_statement>:
    <code>
```

The keyword ```while``` must be included, as well as a ```<true_statment>``` that can be evaluated as ```True``` or ```False```. The ```<code>``` after the while statement must be indented and each line of code that will run as part of the loop needs to be indented the same amount. An example is below:
<div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered">
<div class="input">
<div class="prompt input_prompt">In&nbsp;[1]:</div>
<div class="inner_cell">
    <div class="input_area">
<div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"><pre><span></span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper">
<div class="output">


<div class="output_area">

<div class="prompt"></div>


<div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text">
<pre>0
1
2
3
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
The first line ```i=0``` created a variable ```i``` and assigned it the value ```0```. The next line declared what condition was needed to keep the loop running. The statement ```i<4``` will be ```True``` or ```False``` depending on the variable ```i```. Since ```i=0```, the statement ```i<4``` is ```True``` and the for loop starts to run. The code that run inside the loop prints the value of ```i``` then increases ```i``` by ```1```. When ```i=4```, the statement ```i<4``` is ```False``` and the while loop ends.
### Using a ```while``` loop to validate user input

While loops can be utilized to validate user input. Say we want to insist that a user inputs positive number. We can code this into a while loop that keeps on repeating until the user enters valid input. The code below will continue to ask a user for a positive number until one is entered.
<div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered">
<div class="input">
<div class="prompt input_prompt">In&nbsp;[1]:</div>
<div class="inner_cell">
    <div class="input_area">
<div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"><pre><span></span><span class="n">num_input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">num_input</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">str_input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Enter a positive number: &#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">num_input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">str_input</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper">
<div class="output">


<div class="output_area">

<div class="prompt"></div>


<div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text">
<pre>Enter a positive number: 4
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
In the section of code above, it is important to initialize the variable ```num_input``` with a value that causes the while statement ```num_input < 0``` to evaluate as ```True```. ```num_input = -1``` causes the statement ```num_input < 0``` to evaluate as ```True``` and any other negative number would have worked as well.  If the while statement can't be evaluated as ```True``` or ```False```, Python will throw an error. It is therefore necessary to convert the user's input from a string to a float. The statement ```'5' < 0``` does note evaluate to true or false, because the string ```'5'``` can't be compared to the number ```0```.
