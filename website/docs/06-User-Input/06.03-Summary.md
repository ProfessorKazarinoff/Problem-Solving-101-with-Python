## Summary
In this chapter, you learned about user input and loops in Python.

The chapter started out with a discussion _f-strings_ in Python. f-strings are one way of inserting variables into strings and ```print()``` statements. In Python, f-strings are prepended with the letter ```f```. variables and expression inside of f-strings are enclosed in curly braces ```{ }```.

The general form of an f-string is below.

```python
fstring = f'Insert {variable}'
```

The next part of the chapter was user input and Python's ```input()``` function. Remember that the ```input()``` function outputs a string, not a float or integer. 

Selection structures and ```if``` statements were discussed next. In Python, ```if``` statements can be used to run a block of code if a certain logical condition is ```True```. The general form of an ```if``` statement in Python is below.

```python
if <logical condition>:
    <code>
```

Remember that any code that runs if the ```<logical condition>``` is ```True``` must be indented the same number of spaces. 

The final part of the chapter involved the repetion structures ```for``` loops and ```while``` loops. ```for``` loops run for a defined number of times and can be defined in the following way:

```python
for i in range(<num>):
    <code>
```

Strings and lists can also be used in ```for``` loops. 

The last part the chapter discussed ```while``` loops While loops run as long as a certain logical condition remains ```True```. The general structure of a ```while``` loop in Python is below:
    
```python
while <logical condition>:
    <code>
```

Just like in ```for``` loops, any code to run as part of the ```while``` loop must be indented the name number of spaces.
