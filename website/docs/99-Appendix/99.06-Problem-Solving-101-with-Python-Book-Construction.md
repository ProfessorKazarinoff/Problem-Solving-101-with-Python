## Problem Solving 101 with Python Book Construction
### Jupyter Notebooks
This book was constructed using **jupyter notebooks** saved on github.com. The github repo for the books can be found at:
    
[https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python](https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python)
The directory structure of the github repo contains the **jupyter notebooks** that were use the write the book, a set of conversion tools and the output of these conversion tools, the book website and pdf's that make the hard copy of the book
```

```
The notebooks directory contains a folder for each chapter of the book:
```
Notebooks/
|-- 00-Preface/
|-- 01-What-is-Python/
|-- 02-Installing-Python/
|-- 03-Jupyter-Notebooks/
|-- 04-The-Python-REPL/
|-- 05-Plotting-with-Matplotlib/
|-- 06-User-Input-and-Loops/
|-- 99-Appendix/
|-- figures/
`-- TOC.ipynb
```
Within each chapter directory there is a **jupyter notebook** for each section and an images directory for any images used in the markdown sections of the notebooks

```
01-What-is-Python/
|-- 01.00-Introduction.ipynb
|-- 01.01-What-is-Python.ipynb
|-- 01.02-Why-Python.ipynb
|-- 01.03-What-is-Anaconda.ipynb
|-- 01.04-Summary.ipynb
|-- 01.05-Review-Questions.ipynb
`-- images/
```
### Website
The website for the book was constructed using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [mkdocs-material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). 

Jupyter noteboks were exported to html with the markdown cells unformatted using **nbconvert**. 
### Hardcopy
The hard copy of the book was constructed using **LateX** and **nbconvert**. A conversion script combined all of the notebooks into one BIG notebook and converted the one BIG notebook to **LaTeX** using a custom template.
