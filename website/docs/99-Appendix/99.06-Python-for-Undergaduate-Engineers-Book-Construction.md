## Python for Undergraduate Engineers Book Construction
### Jupyter Notebooks
This book was constructed using **jupyter notebooks** saved on github.com. The github repo for the books can be found at:
    
[https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/PythonForUndergraduateEngineers](https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/PythonForUndergraduateEngineers)
The directory structure of the github repo contains the **jupyter notebooks** that were use the write the book, a set of conversion tools and the output of these conversion tools, the book website and pdf's that make the hard copy of the book
```

```
The notebooks directory contains a folder for each chapter of the book:
```

|-- 00-Preface/
|-- 01-Orientation/
|-- 02-The-Python-REPL/
|-- 03-Data-Types-and-Variables/
|-- 04-Jupyter-Notebooks/

|-- 11-Python-and-External-Hardware/
|-- 12-MicroPython/
|-- 99-Appendix/

`-- TOC.ipynb
```
Within each chapter directory there is a **jupyter notebook** for each section and an images directory for any images used in the markdown sections of the notebooks

```

|-- 01.00-Welcome.ipynb
|-- 01.01-Why-Python.ipynb

|-- 01.03-Installing-Anaconda.ipynb
|-- 01.04-Installing-Anaconda-on-OSX.ipynb
|-- 01.05-Summary.ipynb
|-- 01.06-Review-Questions.ipynb
`-- images/

### Website
The website for the book was constructed using mkdocs. Jupyter noteboks were exported to html with the markdown cells unformatted. 
### Hardcopy
The hard copy of the book was constructed using **LateX** and **nbconvert**. A conversion script combined all of the notebooks into one BIG notebook and converted the one BIG notebook to **LaTeX** using a custom template.
