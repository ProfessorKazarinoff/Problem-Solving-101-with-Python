## Problem Solving 101 with Python Book Construction
### Jupyter Notebooks
This book was constructed using **jupyter notebooks** on a variety of computers. The GitHub repo for the books can be found at:
    
[https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python](https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python)
The directory structure of the GitHub repo contains the **jupyter notebooks** that were use the write the book, a set of conversion tools, and the files used to build the book website. The conversion tools allow the same source notebooks to be converted into three formats: LaTeX, website, and PDF. 
```

|-- conversion_tools/
|-- notebooks/

|-- notebooks/
|-- pdf/
|-- README.md

```
The notebooks directory contains a folder for each chapter of the book:
```
notebooks/
|-- 00-Preface/
|-- 01-What-is-Python/
|-- 02-Installing-Python/
|-- 03-Jupyter-Notebooks/
|-- 04-The-Python-REPL/
|-- 05-Plotting-with-Matplotlib/
|-- 06-User-Input-and-Loops/
|-- 99-Appendix/
|-- figures/
`-- TOC.ipynb
```
Within each chapter directory, there is a **jupyter notebook** for each section and an images directory for any images used in the markdown sections of the notebooks.

```
01-What-is-Python/
|-- 01.00-Introduction.ipynb
|-- 01.01-What-is-Python.ipynb
|-- 01.02-Why-Python.ipynb
|-- 01.03-What-is-Anaconda.ipynb
|-- 01.04-Summary.ipynb
|-- 01.05-Review-Questions.ipynb
`-- images/
```
### Website
The website for the book was constructed using **mkdocs** [https://www.mkdocs.org/](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the **mkdocs-material** [https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). 

**Jupyter noteboks** were exported to html with the markdown cells unformatted using **nbconvert**.
### Hardcopy
The hard copy of the book was constructed using **LateX** and **nbconvert**. A conversion script combined all of the notebooks into one BIG notebook. The conversion script then converted the one BIG combined notebook to **LaTeX** using a **nbconvert** and a custom template. **TeXworks** was used to compile the LaTeX to PDF prior to printing.
