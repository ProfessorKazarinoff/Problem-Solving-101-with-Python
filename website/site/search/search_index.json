At may colleges, MATLAB is used as the computer programming language to solve these problems in undergraduate engineering courses. MATLAB is a great piece of software, but it currently costs $49.00 for a student license and requires a group academic site license to be installed in college computer labs. Subsequently, it is costly for a student to use MATLAB and it is costly for a college to support a course that uses MATLAB. \n\n\nThe Python programming language on the other hand is open source and free. The cost to both the student and the college to download and use Python is zero. By moving undergraduate engineering programming problem solving from MATLAB to Python, students save money and have greater access to the software they use in class. Further in their engineering education, students can continue to use Python for free. Python and the wealth of 3rd party libraries such as \nnumpy\n and \nmatplotlib\n have served to solve any problem I've assigned that MATLAB was used to solve.",

The Python interpreter is a program that runs on your computer. Other programs running on your computer include Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and web browsers like Google Chrome or Firefox. Each of these programs uses a different file type. The file type the Python Interpreter runs are files that contain Python code. You can think of the Python Interpreter like a cook in a restaurant that only does exactly as what is given in a recipe. The recipe is kind of like Python code.

The Python Standard Library contains all the code that can be run by the Python Interpreter. But in addition to the Python Standard Library, there are over 100,000 external modules (many available on PyPI.org) that can be downloaded and used for free. \n\n\nBrief History of Python\n\n\nPython was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch computer programmer, and was first released in 1991. The name \nPython\n is attributed to \nMonte Python\n the British comedy troupe that became popular in the 1970's and 80's for their TV show \nMonte Python's Flying Circus\n and movies like \nMonty Python and the Holy Grail\n.\n\n\nWhy was Python created?\n\n\nGuido created Python based on his experience working with another earlier computer programming language called ABC. Guido had a couple of \"gripes\" with the ABC programming language including its lack of extensibility. He wrote Python partly in response to this problem. Unlike ABC, Python is indeed very extensible. It can be extended with additional packages downloaded from the PyPI.org and runs on servers, desktop computers, laptops and tiny microcontrollers.",

These include math functions, list methods, and calls to a computer's system. There is a lot that can be done with the Python Standard Library. The first couple of chapters of this book will just use the Python Standard Library. It can do a lot.\n\n\nPython defines the types of objects you build into your code. Unlike some other languages such as C, you do not need to declare the object type. The object type is also mutable, you can change the type of object easily and on the fly. There is a wide array of object types built into Python. Objects can change in size. Python objects can also contain mixed data types. For example, strings and floating point numbers can be items in the same list.\n\n\nPython has over 100,000 external packages available for download and use. They are easy to install off of the Python Package Index, commonly called PyPI (\"pie pee eye\"). There is a Python package for just about everything. There are packages which can help you: interact with the web, make complex computations, do unit conversions, plot data, work with .csv, .xls, and .pdf files, manipulate images and video, read data from sensors and test equipment, train machine learning algorithms, design web apps, work with GIS data, work with astronautical data, and many more added every day. In this book, we will use some of the more useful Python packages for problem-solving such as \nnumpy\n and \nmatplotlib\n.\n\n\nPython is easy to learn and use\n\n\nEngineers solve the world's problems in teams. One way Python helps solve these problems faster than other programming languages is that it is easy to learn and use. A Python program tends to be shorter and quicker to write than a program that does a similar function written in other computer programming language. In the rapid design, prototype, test, iterate cycle programming solutions made with Python can be spun up quickly. Python is also an easy language for fellow engineers on your team to learn. It is also quite human readable. While programmers can become preoccupied with a program's running speed, it is program development time that takes the longest.\n\n\nPython is transportable\n\n\nPython can be installed and run on each of the three major operating systems: Windows, MacOS and Linux. On MacOS and Linux, Python comes installed right out of the box. Just open up a terminal in MacOS or Linux and type:\n\n\n$ python\n\n\n\n\nThat's it; you are now using Python. On Windows, I recommend downloading and using the Anaconda distribution of Python. The Anaconda distribution is free and can be installed on all three major operating systems. The same programming environment can be replicated across the three different operating systems.\n\n\nPython is free\n\n\nMATLAB and LabView cost students to use and cost companies and colleges even more. Python is free to download and use. It is also open source, and users are free to modify, contribute, and propose improvements to Python. All of the packages available for download on the Python Package Index, PyPI (pronounced pie-pee-eye) are free to download and install. Many more packages, scripts and utilities can be found in open source repositories on GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. \n\n\nPython is growing\n\n\nPython is growing in popularity. Python use is increasing mainly in the data science, machine learning and computer vision. These are growing team problem-solving areas for engineers.   \n\n\nPython has extensive standard library of modules and a vast array of external modules\n\n\nPythons Standard Library\n\n\nPython Standard Library Modules include:\n\n\nmath, statistics, os, urllib, table for what they are used for. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython Standard Library Module\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath\n\n\nmath functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatistics\n\n\nstatistics functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos\n\n\noperating system functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurllib\n\n\nweb URL's and web access\n\n\n\n\n\n\npath\n\n\nfile path objects and functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Standard Library modules can be found on the \nPython Read-the-docs\n\n\nExternal Modules available on PyPI\n\n\nThere are over 100,000 external modules available for Python on \nPyPI.org\n.

How is it different than Python?\"\n\n\nAnaconda is a Python Distribution\n\n\nAnaconda is a Python Distribution. When you download Anaconda, you download a Python Interpreter plus a bunch of extra useful stuff. \n\n\nHow is Anaconda different from Python?\n\n\nWhen you download Python from Python.org you get the Python Interpreter, a little text editing program called IDLE and all of the Python Standard Library modules.\n\n\nWhen you download Anaconda from Anaconda.com, you get a Python Interpreter,  Anaconda Prompt (a command line program), Spyder (a code editor) and about 200 extra Python modules that aren't included in The Standard Library. The Anaconda distribution of Python also includes a program called Anaconda Navigator that allows you to launch Jupyter Notebooks quickly.\n\n\nWhy download Anaconda if I want to use is Python?\n\n\nRegardless if you download Python from Python.org or if you download Anaconda (with all the extra stuff it comes with) from Anaconda.com, you will be able to write and execute Python code. However, there are a couple of advantages to using the Anaconda distribution of Python.\n\n\nAnaconda includes Python plus about 200 additional Python packages\n\n\nAnaconda is advantageous because it includes Python as well as about 200 additional Python packages. These other packages are all free to use. The packages that come with Anaconda includes many of the most common Python packages use to solve problems. If you download Anaconda, you get Python including The Standard Library plus 200 extra packages. If you download Python from Python.org, you just get Python and The Standard Library but no additional modules. You could install the extra modules that come with Anaconda (that don't come with plain old Python), but why not save a step (or 200 steps) and download one thing (Anaconda) instead of downloading 201 and one things (200 extra modules + 1 Python download).\n\n\nAnaconda installs without administrator privileges\n\n\nEven if you don't have the ability to install program on a computer, like a computer in a school computer lab, you can still download and use Anaconda. The Anaconda distribution of Python will also allow you to install additional modules from the Python package index (\nPyPI.org\n) and conda-forge, the conda package index.\n\n\nAnaconda works on MacOS\n\n\nIf you use MacOS, you probably already have Python installed on your computer. Most MacOS installations come with Python included. The problem is that the version of Python that comes with MacOS is old (usually legacy Python, Python 2) and the version of Python that comes with MacOS is locked up behind a set of administrator privileges. Because the pre-installed version of Python can require administrator privileges, you can have trouble using the version of Python that comes on MacOS. Some things will seem to work fine, and then other things won't run at all, or you will keep getting asked for an administrator password over and over. Downloading and installing Anaconda (separate from the version of Python that came with MacOS) prevents most of these problems.\n\n\nAnaconda makes package management and virtual environments easier\n\n\nAnother advantage of Anaconda is that package management and virtual environments are a lot easier when you have Anaconda. Virtual environments and package handling might not seem to make a huge difference right now. If you just downloaded Anaconda for the first time, you are probably not dealing with package management and virtual environments yet. (It's OK if you don't even know what those two things are yet). After you write a couple of Python programs and start downloading a couple of extra modules from PyPI or conda-forge, dealing with package management and virtual environments becomes more critical.",

Jupyter notebooks provide a quick and streamlined way for engineers to prototype code and quickly share code.  Jupyter notebooks also provide a way for engineers to share solutions with team members, supervisors and customers.   In a way, Jupyter notebooks strike a balance between simple text editors, which are fast to start and simple and easy to manipulate, and IDE's which tend to start slower and be feature-rich and complex. Simple text editors typically can only edit code, and cannot run code. A full IDE can edit code, run code, debug code, provide syntax highlighting and context help.\nIn the context of problem-solving, Jupyter Notebooks make much sense. They are quick to spin up and quick to provide output. Data exploration, data cleaning, and plot building can be accomplished in a Jupyter notebook easier and quicker than in a text editor or an IDE.   In the context of sharing solutions to problems, Jupyter notebooks are also useful. Markdown cells can render text in different sizes, bold and italic. Tables and images can be, and plots and code output are all shown in the notebook.",

These formats can be accessed on the  [File]  -->  [Download As]  menu.   The available file types are:   Notebook (.ipynb) - The native Jupyter notebook format  Python (.py) - The native Python code file format.  HTML (.html) - An html web page  Markdown (.md) - Markdown format  reST (.rst) - Restructured text format  LaTeX (.tex) - LaTeX format  PDF via LaTeX - a pdf exported from LeTeX, requires a converter   When a Notebook is saved as a  .py  file, any text in markdown cells is converted to comments, and any code cells are kept as Python code. The  .py  file after a notebook is  Downloaded as  a  Python(.py)  looks like:",

It can also be used for trigonometric calculations and statistical calculations.\n\n\nArithmetic\n\n\nPython can be used as a calculator to make simple or complex calculations. \n\n\nWe can do this easily with Python at the Python Prompt, often called the Python REPL for Read Evaluate Print Loop. The Python REPL shows three arrow symbols \n>>>\n after which you will see a blinking cursor. Programmers type commands at the prompt then hit [ENTER]. The is Read by the interperator, results of running the commands are Evaluated then Printed to the command window.  After the output a new \n>>>\n prompt appears on a new line. This process happens over and over again (in a loop). Try the following commands at the Python REPL:\n\n\n\n\nThe mass of a battery is 5 kg and the mass of the battery cables is 3 kg. What is the mass of the battery cable assembly?\n\n\n\n\n>>> 5 + 3\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose one of the cables above is removed and it has a mass of 1.5 kg. What is the mass of the left over assembly\n\n\n\n\n>>> 8 - 1.5\n6.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the battery has a mass of 5000 g and a volume of 2500 \ncm^3\ncm^3\n What is the density of the battery? The formula for density is below, where D is density, m is mass and v is volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n D = \\frac{m}{v} \n\n\n D = \\frac{m}{v} \n\n\n\n\nIn the problem above \nm = 5000\nm = 5000\n and \nv=2500\nv=2500\n\n\nLet's solve this with Python\n\n\n>>> 5000 / 2500\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we have 2 batteries that each weight 5 kg?

In order to use these functions, we need to learn a new concept: importing modules. \nIn python there are many functions built into the language when it starts. These include + , -, *, / like we say in the last section. However not all functions will work right when python starts. Say we want to find the sin of an angle. Try the following:\n\n\n>>> sin(60)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'sin' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nThis error is returned because we have not told python to include the sin function. The sin function is part of the \\textit{standard library}. The standard library comes with every python installation and includes many functions, but not all of these functions are available to us when we start a new python window. In order to use the sin function, we first need to import it from math \\textit{module} which is part of the standard library. \n\n\nImporting modules and functions is easy. We use the following syntax: from \\textit{module name} import textit{function name} \n\n\nTo import the sin function from the math module try:\n\n\n>>> from math import sin\n>>> sin(60)\n-0.3048106211022167\n\n\n\n\nsuccess! You can also import multiple modules at once. Say we want to use a bunch of different trig functions to solve the following problem.\n\n\n\n\nA vector is at an angle of pi/6 radians. What is the sin, cos and tan of the angle?\n\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem we need to import the sin, cos, and tan fuctions. It would also be usefull to have the value of pi, rather than having to write 3.14....

To access these statistics functions we need to import them from the \nstatistics\n module using the statement \nfrom statistics import mean, median, mode, stdev\n.

            "text": "Line Plots\n\n\nLine plots in matplotlib can be created using matplotlib's pyplot library. To create a line plot with Python and matplotlib, first import matplotlib's pyplot library using the line:\n\n\nimport matplot.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\n\nIt is common practice to use the alias \nplt\n for the \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n library. Defining \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n as \nplt\n allows us to use the syntax \nplt.<function name>\n instead of \nmatplotlib.pyplot.<function name>\n in the rest of our code. See the differences below:\n\n\nImporting \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n with no alias:\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot\n\nmatplotlib.pyplot.plot(x, y)\n\n\n\n\nImporting \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n with the alias \nplt\n:\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.plot(x, y)\n\n\n\n\nUsing the alias \nplt\n simplifies the code and cuts down the number of keystrokes needed to create a plot. Any alias can be used, such as \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as RainbowUnicorn\n, but the alias \nplt\n is the standard convention.\n\n\nIf building matplotlib plots in a Jupyter notebook, include the line:\n\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\n\n\n\nBelow the import line. The \n%matplotlib inline\n line will output matplotlib plots directly in Jupyter notebook output cells.\nTo build the first line plot, first import matplotlib. If using a jupyter notebook include the line \n%matplotlib inline\n.\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# if using a Jupyter notebook, include:\n%matplotlib inline\n\n\n\n\nOnce matplotlib is imported, and plots are set to display in Jupyter notebook output cells, we need data to plot. We will create the data as a Python \nlist\n. In Python, \nlist\n is a built-in data structure which can store multiple values. Lists are defined in Python using square brackets \n[ ]\n. The elements of a list are separated using commas \n[item1, item2, item 3]\n.\n\n\nAn example line of code to create a list of numbers in Python is below:\n\n\na = [1, 3, 4, 8]\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers 1, 3, 4, and 8 are stored in a list. Once the list is defined, we can plot the values using matplotlib's \nplt.plot()\n function. To create a line plot, pass the list of numbers as an \nargument\n to the \nplt.plot()\n function. Arguments are values passed to functions as input. The command \nplt.show()\n is needed at the end to show the plot. Make sure to include the double parenthesis \n()\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[1]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n \nas\n \nplt\n\n\n# if using a Jupyter notebook, include:\n\n\n%\nmatplotlib\n inline\n\n\na\n \n=\n \n[\n1\n,\n \n3\n,\n \n4\n,\n \n8\n]\n\n\nplt\n.\nplot\n(\na\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nshow\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA line plot of the numbers 1, 3, 4, 8 is produced. Note the points 1, 3, 4, 8 are the y-values on the plot. The x-axis starts at zero and ends at three. Matplotlib automatically set the x-axis values, because only one list was supplied to \nplt.plot()\n. Let's specify two lists, one for the x-values on the plot called \nx\n and one for the y-values on the plot called \ny\n. With these two lists created, call \nplt.plot(x,y)\n and \nplt.show()\n and see the changes on a new plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[2]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n \nas\n \nplt\n\n\n# if using a Jupyter notebook, include:\n\n\n%\nmatplotlib\n inline\n\n\nx\n \n=\n \n[\n0\n,\n \n2\n,\n \n4\n,\n \n6\n]\n\n\ny\n \n=\n \n[\n1\n,\n \n3\n,\n \n4\n,\n \n8\n]\n\n\nplt\n.\nplot\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nshow\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA line plot with x-values 0, 2, 4, 6 is produced. By specifying two lists to \nplt.plot()\n, we control both the x and y points shown in the line plot. The plot works, but it is pretty basic. In the next section, you will learn how to customize matplotlib plots.\n\n\nCustomizing matplotlib plots\n\n\nMatplotlib plots can be customized in many ways. Let's build upon the previous example and add a couple of features to the line plot. These additional plot features include:\n\n\n\n\nAxis Labels, Title, and Legend\n\n\nLine Color, Line Width, Line Style, Line Opacity and Marker Options\n\n\n\n\nAxis Labels, Title, and Legend\n\n\nAxis labels, a title, and a legend are added to line plots constructed with matplotlib. Each of these features is specified with a different matplotlib command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot feature\n\n\nmatplotlib command\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx-axis label\n\n\nplt.xlabel()\n\n\nplt.xlabel('time in seconds')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx-axis limits\n\n\nplt.xlim()\n\n\nplt.xlim([0, 10])\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny-axis label\n\n\nplt.ylabel()\n\n\nplt.ylabel('distance in meters')\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny-axis limits\n\n\nplt.ylim()\n\n\nplt.ylim([-5, 5])\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nplt.title()\n\n\nplt.title('distance vs. time')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlegend\n\n\nplt.legend()\n\n\nplt.legend(['run 1'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the words passed into the \nplt.xlabel()\n, \nplt.ylabel()\n and \nplt.title()\n need to be enclosed in quotation marks \n'  '\n. In Python, quotation marks denote \nstrings\n. A string is a Python data type which contains letter, numbers, punctuation, symbols, and spaces. The \nplt.legend()\n function expects a \nlist of strings\n. \n\n\nA list of strings is similar to a list of numbers. The list is defined using square brackets \n[ ]\n. A list of strings needs to have each string enclosed in quotes \n'  '\n and separated by a comma \n,\n as in \n['string1','string2',string3']\n. If there is only one line on a plot, only one string needs to be in the list strings passed to \nplt.legend()\n. Even if there is only one string in a list, the square brackets used to define the list still need to be included (otherwise a simple string is defined, not a list of strings).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[3]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n \nas\n \nplt\n\n\n# if using a Jupyter notebook, include:\n\n\n%\nmatplotlib\n inline\n\n\nx\n \n=\n \n[\n0\n,\n \n2\n,\n \n4\n,\n \n6\n]\n\n\ny\n \n=\n \n[\n1\n,\n \n3\n,\n \n4\n,\n \n8\n]\n\n\nplt\n.\nplot\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nxlabel\n(\n'x values'\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nxlim\n([\n-\n1\n,\n7\n])\n\n\nplt\n.\nylabel\n(\n'y values'\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nylim\n([\n0\n,\n10\n])\n\n\nplt\n.\ntitle\n(\n'plotted x and y values'\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nlegend\n([\n'line 1'\n])\n\n\nplt\n.\nshow\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Color, Line Width, Line Style, Line Opacity and Marker Options\n\n\nLine color, line width, line style, and markers options can be customized in a matplotlib plot. Line color, line width, and line style are included as extra \nkeyword arguments\n in the \nplt.plot()\n function call. A keyword argument is a special type of argument passed into a function that must be stated explicitly by name. Regular arguments passed to functions are called \npositional arguments\n. Positional arguments need to be passed to the function in order, but positional argument names do not need to be specified. In the code line below \nx\n and \ny\n are positional arguments and \ncolor='r'\n is a keyword argument. \n\n\nplt.plot(x, y, color='r')\n\n\n\n\nExamples of some of the keyword arguments that can be specified in a \nplt.plot()\n function call are in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot feature\n\n\nplt.plot()\n keyword argument\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwidth of line\n\n\nlinewidth\n\n\nplt.plot(x, y, linewidth = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsolid, dashed, dotted line\n\n\nlinestyle\n\n\nplt.plot(x, y, linestyle = '-')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nline color\n\n\ncolor\n\n\nplt.plot(x, y, color = 'red')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nline opacity (transparency)\n\n\nalpha\n\n\nplt.plot(x, y, alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmarker shape\n\n\nmarker\n\n\nplt.plot(x, y, marker = 'o')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general format of a \nplt.plot()\n function call with lots of options specified is: \n\n\nplt.plot(<x-data>,<y-data>,\n         linewideth=<float or int>,\n         linestyle='<linestyle abbreviation>',\n         color='<color abbreviation>', \n         marker='<marker abbreviation>')\n\n\n\n\nAn example \nplt.plot()\n line including line width, style, color, opacity  and marker type is: \n\n\nplt.plot(x, y, \n         linewidth=2.0,\n         linestyle='+',\n         color='b',\n         alpha=0.5,\n         marker='o')\n\n\n\n\nline width\n\n\nBelow is a list of line widths (many other widths are also available)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlinewidth=<float or int>\n\n\nLine Width\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.5 pixels wide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1 pixel wide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n1.5 pixels wide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2 pixels wide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3 pixels wide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nline style\n\n\nBelow is a list of line styles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlinestyle='<style abbreviation>'\n\n\nLine Style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'-'\n or \n'solid'\n\n\nsolid line (default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'--'\n or \n'dashed'\n\n\ndashed line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'-.'\n or \n'dashdot'\n\n\ndash-dot line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n':'\n or \n'dotted'\n\n\ndotted line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'None'\n or \n' '\n or \n''\n\n\nno line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolor\n\n\nBelow is a list of color abbreviations.

            "text": "Line plots in matplotlib can be created using matplotlib's pyplot library. To create a line plot with Python and matplotlib, first import matplotlib's pyplot library using the line:  import matplot.pyplot as plt  It is common practice to use the alias  plt  for the  matplotlib.pyplot  library. Defining  matplotlib.pyplot  as  plt  allows us to use the syntax  plt.<function name>  instead of  matplotlib.pyplot.<function name>  in the rest of our code. See the differences below:  Importing  matplotlib.pyplot  with no alias:  import matplotlib.pyplot\n\nmatplotlib.pyplot.plot(x, y)  Importing  matplotlib.pyplot  with the alias  plt :  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.plot(x, y)  Using the alias  plt  simplifies the code and cuts down the number of keystrokes needed to create a plot. Any alias can be used, such as  import matplotlib.pyplot as RainbowUnicorn , but the alias  plt  is the standard convention.  If building matplotlib plots in a Jupyter notebook, include the line:  %matplotlib inline  Below the import line. The  %matplotlib inline  line will output matplotlib plots directly in Jupyter notebook output cells.\nTo build the first line plot, first import matplotlib. If using a jupyter notebook include the line  %matplotlib inline .  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# if using a Jupyter notebook, include:\n%matplotlib inline  Once matplotlib is imported, and plots are set to display in Jupyter notebook output cells, we need data to plot. We will create the data as a Python  list . In Python,  list  is a built-in data structure which can store multiple values. Lists are defined in Python using square brackets  [ ] . The elements of a list are separated using commas  [item1, item2, item 3] .  An example line of code to create a list of numbers in Python is below:  a = [1, 3, 4, 8]  The numbers 1, 3, 4, and 8 are stored in a list. Once the list is defined, we can plot the values using matplotlib's  plt.plot()  function. To create a line plot, pass the list of numbers as an  argument  to the  plt.plot()  function. Arguments are values passed to functions as input. The command  plt.show()  is needed at the end to show the plot. Make sure to include the double parenthesis  () .   In\u00a0[1]:  \n      import   matplotlib.pyplot   as   plt  # if using a Jupyter notebook, include:  % matplotlib  inline  a   =   [ 1 ,   3 ,   4 ,   8 ]  plt . plot ( a )  plt . show ()                \nA line plot of the numbers 1, 3, 4, 8 is produced. Note the points 1, 3, 4, 8 are the y-values on the plot. The x-axis starts at zero and ends at three. Matplotlib automatically set the x-axis values, because only one list was supplied to  plt.plot() . Let's specify two lists, one for the x-values on the plot called  x  and one for the y-values on the plot called  y . With these two lists created, call  plt.plot(x,y)  and  plt.show()  and see the changes on a new plot.   In\u00a0[2]:  \n      import   matplotlib.pyplot   as   plt  # if using a Jupyter notebook, include:  % matplotlib  inline  x   =   [ 0 ,   2 ,   4 ,   6 ]  y   =   [ 1 ,   3 ,   4 ,   8 ]  plt . plot ( x , y )  plt . show ()                \nA line plot with x-values 0, 2, 4, 6 is produced. By specifying two lists to  plt.plot() , we control both the x and y points shown in the line plot. The plot works, but it is pretty basic.

In Python, quotation marks denote  strings . A string is a Python data type which contains letter, numbers, punctuation, symbols, and spaces. The  plt.legend()  function expects a  list of strings .   A list of strings is similar to a list of numbers. The list is defined using square brackets  [ ] . A list of strings needs to have each string enclosed in quotes  '  '  and separated by a comma  ,  as in  ['string1','string2',string3'] . If there is only one line on a plot, only one string needs to be in the list strings passed to  plt.legend() .

            "text": "Multi Line Plots\n\n\nMulti-line plots are created using \nmatplotlib's\n pyplot library. In this section, we build upon the previous section where a plot with one line was created.\nTo construct the data series for the multi-line plot, the \nnumpy\n package will be utilized. \nNumpy\n is a Python package useful for dealing with numerical data, particularly numerical data stored in matrices and arrays. Instead of defining a Python list of numbers to plot, the \nnumpy\n package is used to create an \narray\n of numbers. An array is a \nhomogeneous data structure\n. Homogeneous data structures, like arrays, only contains one data type. Arrays are different from Python lists because Python lists are \nheterogeneous data structures\n. Heterogeneous data structures, like Python lists, can contain many different data types. are one dimensional and can contain many different data types.\n\n\nThe \nnumpy\n array below is a homogeneous data structure. The array only contains floating point numbers (```type float)\n\n\narray([ 5.1,  0.004,  999.9,  0.0])\n\n\n\n\nThe Python list below is a homogeneous data structure. The list contains three different data types: an integer, a float and a string.\n\n\nmylist = [ 4, 0.003, 'red' ]\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of using \nnumpy\n arrays instead of Python lists is that mathematical operations can be run on an entire array at the same time. To run the same mathematical operation on each element in a Python list, a for loop (covered in the next chapter) is needed. When building plots, it is common to apply the same mathematical operation on every number in a range or apply the same mathematical operation on every value in a dataset. Therefore \nnumpy\n arrays are quite useful for building plot.\nBefore the \nnumpy\n module is used in a Python script, \nnumpy\n first needs to be imported. By convention \nnumpy\n is imported as \nnp\n.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n\n\n\nOnce imported, \nnumpy\n functions, such as \nnp.arange()\n and \nnp.sin()\n function. A difference between \nnumpy's\n \nnp.sin()\n function, compared to the function \nmath.sin()\n from Python's standard library, is that \nnp.sin()\n calculates the sine of every element in an array. \nmath.sin()\n, from the Python Standard Library, only calculate the sine of one number. \n\n\nNumpy's\n \nnp.arange()\n function creates an array according to the following specifications:\n\n\nnp.arange(start, stop+step, step)\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nstart\n is the first number in the array, \nstop\n is the last number in the array, and \nstep\n is how far apart the numbers in the array are. \nPython counting starts at zero and ends at n-1\n. This means the second argument (\nstop + step\n) is not included in the final array. The final value in the array is \nstop\n.  One extra number, beyond the last number you want in the array, needs to be specified. This type of interval is called a \nhalf-open interval\n. \n\n\nAn \nnumpy\n array starting at 0, ending at 10 and counting by 2's is coded by:\n\n\nnp.arange(0, 12, 2)\n\n\n\n\nThe result is:\n\n\narray([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10])\n\n\n\n\nNotice how \n12\n is included in the function call \nnp.arange(0, 12, 2)\n, but \n10\n is the last number in the array.\n\n\nTo construct a line plot of the sine function, import \nnumpy\n and build an array that ranges from 0 to 4\n\\pi\n\\pi\n in increments of 0.01. Then use \nnp.sin()\n to calculate the sine of each value stored in the array. Finally, plot the results using \nmatplotlib's\n \nplt.plot()\n function.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[1]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n \nas\n \nplt\n\n\nimport\n \nnumpy\n \nas\n \nnp\n\n\n# if using a Jupyter Notebook include\n\n\n%\nmatplotlib\n inline\n\n\nx\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\narange\n(\n0\n,\n \n4\n*\nnp\n.\npi\n+\n0.1\n,\n \n0.1\n)\n\n\ny\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\nsin\n(\nx\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nplot\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nshow\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo construct a plot which contains two lines, create two arrays of y-points and pass the arrays of y-points along with a corresponding set of x-points to the \nplt.plot()\n function.\n\n\nplt.plot(x1,y1,x2,y2)\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nx\n,\ny1\n creates the first line on the plot and \nx\n,\ny2\n creates the second line on the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[2]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n \nas\n \nplt\n\n\nimport\n \nnumpy\n \nas\n \nnp\n\n\n# if using a Jupyter Notebook include:\n\n\n%\nmatplotlib\n inline\n\n\nx\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\narange\n(\n0\n,\n \n4\n*\nnp\n.\npi\n,\n \n0.1\n)\n\n\ny1\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\nsin\n(\nx\n)\n\n\ny2\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\ncos\n(\nx\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nplot\n(\nx\n,\ny1\n,\nx\n,\ny2\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nshow\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA legend is added to the plot by calling \nplt.legend()\n.

            "text": "Multi-line plots are created using  matplotlib's  pyplot library. In this section, we build upon the previous section where a plot with one line was created.\nTo construct the data series for the multi-line plot, the  numpy  package will be utilized.  Numpy  is a Python package useful for dealing with numerical data, particularly numerical data stored in matrices and arrays. Instead of defining a Python list of numbers to plot, the  numpy  package is used to create an  array  of numbers. An array is a  homogeneous data structure . Homogeneous data structures, like arrays, only contains one data type. Arrays are different from Python lists because Python lists are  heterogeneous data structures . Heterogeneous data structures, like Python lists, can contain many different data types. are one dimensional and can contain many different data types.  The  numpy  array below is a homogeneous data structure. The array only contains floating point numbers (```type float)  array([ 5.1,  0.004,  999.9,  0.0])  The Python list below is a homogeneous data structure. The list contains three different data types: an integer, a float and a string.  mylist = [ 4, 0.003, 'red' ]  The advantage of using  numpy  arrays instead of Python lists is that mathematical operations can be run on an entire array at the same time. To run the same mathematical operation on each element in a Python list, a for loop (covered in the next chapter) is needed. When building plots, it is common to apply the same mathematical operation on every number in a range or apply the same mathematical operation on every value in a dataset. Therefore  numpy  arrays are quite useful for building plot.\nBefore the  numpy  module is used in a Python script,  numpy  first needs to be imported. By convention  numpy  is imported as  np .  import numpy as np  Once imported,  numpy  functions, such as  np.arange()  and  np.sin()  function. A difference between  numpy's   np.sin()  function, compared to the function  math.sin()  from Python's standard library, is that  np.sin()  calculates the sine of every element in an array.  math.sin() , from the Python Standard Library, only calculate the sine of one number.   Numpy's   np.arange()  function creates an array according to the following specifications:  np.arange(start, stop+step, step)  Where  start  is the first number in the array,  stop  is the last number in the array, and  step  is how far apart the numbers in the array are.  Python counting starts at zero and ends at n-1 . This means the second argument ( stop + step ) is not included in the final array. The final value in the array is  stop .  One extra number, beyond the last number you want in the array, needs to be specified. This type of interval is called a  half-open interval .   An  numpy  array starting at 0, ending at 10 and counting by 2's is coded by:  np.arange(0, 12, 2)  The result is:  array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10])  Notice how  12  is included in the function call  np.arange(0, 12, 2) , but  10  is the last number in the array.  To construct a line plot of the sine function, import  numpy  and build an array that ranges from 0 to 4 \\pi \\pi  in increments of 0.01. Then use  np.sin()  to calculate the sine of each value stored in the array. Finally, plot the results using  matplotlib's   plt.plot()  function.

Decimal percentages, or any list of floats and integers can be used to construct a pie chart.\nWe will build our first pie chart to describe the cost breakdown of building a microcontroller.  The cost breakdown for a manufactured item, like a microcontroller, can be divided into four cost categories: engineering (including design), manufacturing (including raw materials), sales (including marketing) and profit.  These cost categories applied to a $9.00 microcontroller:   Engineering $1.35  Manufacturing $3.60  Sales $2.25   Profit $1.80   Our pie chart will show the cost breakdown as different sized pieces.  Matplotlib's    plt.pie()  function only requires one positional argument, a list or array of sizes.  The sizes list or array passed to ```plt.pie() do not need to be normalized (add up to 100\\%).   To custruct the chart, import  matplotlib  and include  %matplotlib inline  if using a jupyter notebook. Create a list of pie piece sizes and call the  plt.pie()  function.  We can add some labels to our pie chart with the keyword argument  labels=  included in the  plt.pie()  fuction call. The labels need to be a Python list of strings.  A title is added to the pie chart with  plt.title() . This syntax is similar to including titles on line and bar plots.  It is important to include the line  plt.axis('equal')  when building pie charts in  matplotlib . This line sets the x and y axis scales as equal, which forces the pie chart into a circle shape.

F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}    F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}    We can code the Fibonacci sequence eight terms long using a for loop. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence  F_1  and  F_2  need to be defined before the loops starts.   Then each time through the loop:\n * the next term in the sequence  F  equals  F_1  (the last number) and  F_2  (the second to last number). \n *  F_2  becomes the second to last number (the value of the number  F_1 )\n *  F_1  becomes the last number (the value of  F ).      In\u00a0[32]:  \n      F_1   =   1  F_2   =   1  for   i   in   range ( 7 ): \n     print ( F_2 ,   end = ' ' ) \n     F   =   F_1   +   F_2 \n     F_2   =   F_1 \n     F_1   =   F           1 1 2 3 5 8 13",

A virtual environment is a standalone Python interpreter and isolated installed packages unique to that environment. \n\n\nBenefits of Virtual Environments\n\n\nVirtual environments keep the Python version and stand-alone package versions all in the same place. If two different projects use two different versions of Python or use two different versions of an installed 3rd-party package, virtual environments separates these two installations separate. \n\n\nThe Python version and installed packages in a virtual environment can be shared with others in the form of a \nrequirements.txt\n or \nenvironment.yml\n file. These files can be shared to produce the same environment on another machine or so the same environment can be reproduced by another programmer.\n\n\nGet the current Python interpreter\n\n\nThe file path to the current running Python interpreter can be accessed using the \nsys\n module. \nsys.prefix\n will output the system path for the running Python interpreter\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[14]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\nsys\n.\nprefix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[14]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'/home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/book'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a list of installed packages\n\n\nA list of installed packages in the current environment can be accessed using the \nsite\n module. \nsite.getsitepackages()\n will return the file path where the site-packages are stored.

To create the new virtual environment, issue the following command at the \nAnaconda Prompt\n:\n\n\n> conda create --name <env_name> python=3.6\n\n\n\n\nThe \nconda create\n command builds the new virtual environment. The \n--name <env_name>\n flag gives the new virtual environment the name \n<env_name>\n. Replace \n<env_name>\n with the name of the new virtual environment. Including \npython=3.6\n ensures the virtual environment has an up to date version of Python. \n\n\nAfter issuing the command, the output will be something like:\n\n\nThe following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:\n\n    certifi:        2016.2.28-py36_0\n    pip:            9.0.1-py36_1\n    python:         3.6.2-0\n    setuptools:     36.4.0-py36_0\n    vs2015_runtime: 14.0.25420-0\n    wheel:          0.29.0-py36_0\n    wincertstore:   0.2-py36_0\n\nProceed ([y]/n)? y\n\n\n\n\nType \ny\n to confirm and create the new virtual environment. To use the new virtual environment, it needs to be  \nactivated\n. A virtual environment is activated by typing the command below. Note that \n<env_name>\n needs to be replaced by the name of the virtual environment.\n\n\n>  conda activate <env_name>\n\n\n\n\nYou know you are in your virtual environment \n<env_name>\n when \n(<env_name>)\n is in parenthesis at the start of the \nAnaconda Prompt\n:\n\n\n> (webscrape)\n\n\n\n\nTo deactivate an active environment, type:\n\n\n> conda deactivate\n\n\n\n\nIf you see the \n(<env_name>)\n in parenthesis before the command prompt, that means the new virtual environment is set up and active. A list of your virtual environments installed on your machine can be accessed using the \nconda info --envs\n or \nconda env list\n commands.\n\n\n> conda info --envs\n\n# conda environments:\n#\nmatplotlib               /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/matplotlib\nwebscrape              * /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/webscrape\nbase                     /home/tribilium/anaconda3\n\n\n\n\nNotice the \n*\n asterisk on the line with \nwebscrape\n. The virtual environment with the \n*\n is currently active. \n\n\nTo exit the virtual environment, use the command \nconda deactivate\n. If \nconda env list\n is run again, there will  not be an asterisk \n*\n in front of \nwebscrape\n. That's because \nwebscrape\n is not the active virtual environment.\n\n\n> conda env list\n\n# conda environments:\n#\nmatplotlib               /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/matplotlib\nwebscrape                /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/webscrape\nbase                  *  /home/tribilium/anaconda3\n\n\n\n\nVirtual environments with pip and virtualenv\n\n\nVirtual environments can also be created with \npip\n, and a 3rd-party python environment manager \nvirtualenv\n. \nvirtualenv\n is a Python package used to create and manage virtual environments. To use \nvirtualenv\n, first make sure it is installed using \npip\n at the commandline.\n\n\n$ pip install virtualenv\n\n\n\n\nOnce installed, \nvirtualenv\n will create a new virtual environment with the command below. Note \n<env_name>\n needs to be replaced by the name of the new virtual environment.\n\n\n$ virtualenv <env_name>\n\n\n\n\nTo activate the virtual environment use the command:\n\n\n$ source bin/activate\n\n\n\n\nOnce active, the virtual environment name will be shown in parenthesis \n()\n before the command prompt\n\n\n(<env_name>)$\n\n\n\n\nThe location of the Python interpreter being used by the currenly active virtual environment can be found with:\n\n\n(<env_name>)$ which python\n/Users/peter/<env_name>/bin/python\n\n\n\n\nTo exit the virtual environment use the command \ndeactivate\n:\n\n\n(<env_name>)$ deactivate\n\n\n\n\nWhen the virtual environment is no longer active, there will be no environment name before the command prompt. A check for the current Python interpreter will return a different path than before when the virtual environment was active\n\n\n$ which python\n/usr/bin/python",
